        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Prepare to embark on a culinary journey with juane, a beloved Peruvian delicacy bursting with flavor and history. Begin by crafting the flavorful filling, combining tender pieces of chicken with a medley of spices such as cumin, garlic, and aji amarillo, infusing the meat with a tantalizing aroma.<br> Next, prepare a fragrant mixture of rice, olives, hard-boiled eggs, and raisins, adding layers of texture and complexity to the dish. Encase this flavorful concoction in a blanket of banana leaves, carefully folding and tying them to create neat parcels. Steam the juanes until the aroma fills the air and the flavors meld together harmoniously. </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of rice</li>
            <li>1 pound of chicken breast or thighs, diced</li>
            <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of sliced black olives</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of raisins</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of aji amarillo paste (Peruvian yellow chili paste), or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Banana leaves</li>
            <li>Cooking twine or toothpicks</li>
            <li>Water or chicken broth, as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the diced chicken with the chopped onion, minced garlic, aji amarillo paste, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Mix well to ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the spices. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a pot, bring 4 cups of water or chicken broth to a boil. Add the rice and a pinch of salt, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and fluffy. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Take a large banana leaf and cut it into square pieces, about 12 inches by 12 inches. If the banana leaves are tough, you can soften them by passing them quickly over an open flame or by steaming them.</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of cooked rice in the center of each banana leaf square. Top with a few pieces of marinated chicken, slices of hard-boiled egg, some sliced black olives, and a sprinkle of raisins.</li>
            <li>Carefully fold the banana leaf over the filling to form a neat parcel, then secure the edges with cooking twine or toothpicks to hold the shape together.</li>
            <li>In a large steamer pot, arrange the juanes in a single layer, making sure they are not overcrowded. Steam them over medium heat for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors have melded together.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, carefully unwrap the banana leaves and serve the juanes hot. Enjoy this traditional Peruvian dish with a side of salsa criolla (Peruvian onion salsa) or aji sauce for an extra kick of flavor.</li>
        </ol>
