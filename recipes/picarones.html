        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (about 400g) of mashed sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup (about 200g) of pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>2 cups (about 250g) of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground anise</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (about 50g) of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup (about 240ml) of warm water</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>Chancaca syrup or molasses, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed sweet potatoes, pumpkin puree, flour, yeast, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground anise, and granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the warm water to the mixture, stirring continuously, until a smooth and slightly sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rest in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
            <li>Once the dough has risen, heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or pot to about 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, then take portions of the dough and shape them into rings, about 3 inches (7-8 cm) in diameter, using your fingers to form a hole in the center of each ring.</li>
            <li>Carefully place the formed picarones into the hot oil, frying them in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the picarones for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried picarones from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve the picarones warm, drizzled with chancaca syrup or molasses for an authentic touch.</li>
            <li>Enjoy these delicious Peruvian treats as a delightful dessert or snack, savoring their sweet and spiced flavors with each bite.</li>
