        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delight in the vibrant hues and wholesome flavors of our green noodles recipe. Begin by selecting your preferred green noodles, whether it's spinach-infused strands or traditional noodles dyed with fresh spinach puree. In a pot of boiling salted water, cook the noodles until they achieve a perfect al dente texture.<br>Meanwhile, in a blender, concoct a verdant sauce by blitzing together fresh spinach leaves, garlic cloves, and a drizzle of olive oil until smooth and fragrant. Once the noodles are cooked, toss them generously in the vibrant green sauce, ensuring each strand is coated in its verdant embrace. Serve piping hot, optionally garnished with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese for added richness. </p>
